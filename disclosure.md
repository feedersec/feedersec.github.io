# Dislosure Policy
Please note that I have the following policy regarding publicly disclosing
vulnerabilities:

1. Best effort will be made to contact the vendor/application developer to
discuss the vulnerability. Two attempts will be made in a 7 day period to
make contact. If after this time no response is received from the vendor,
the vulnerability will be published.
2. Once confirmation of the vulnerability is received from the vendor, I
will work to provide any additional information required to assist with
resolution. I do not expect payment or any other benefit. Acknowledgement in the release notes for the fix would be appreciated.
3. After 45 days of me initiating first contact with the vendor or on
confirmation from the vendor that the vulnerability is fixed, the
vulnerability will be published.
